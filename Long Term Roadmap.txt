🔮 Long-Term Vision for the Renamer
Think of it as a media ingestion engine with three layers:
1. 	Core Renaming Logic
• 	EXIF DateTaken parsing
• 	Duplicate handling (overwrite, skip, hybrid)
• 	Fallbacks for missing metadata
• 	Batch cancel and safety modes
2. 	Smart Detection Layer
• 	Receipt/document detection → split into 
• 	Video normalization/transcoding → ensure web playback compatibility
• 	Optional face/object tagging (future AI expansion)
3. 	Integration Layer
• 	Audit logging (console/file/both)
• 	Web API endpoints → family site ingestion portal
• 	Configurable rules hub (UI + JSON config)
• 	Sync hooks → OneDrive/local archive

🛠️ Next Steps to Streamline for Endgame
Here’s how we can prepare now:
• 	Abstract the logic:
• 	Separate renaming engine from UI.
• 	Make the backend callable via CLI or API.
• 	This way, the web portal can reuse the same engine without duplication.
• 	Design modular options:
• 	Advanced Options hub should be extensible.
• 	Add toggles for detection, audit verbosity, destination paths.
• 	Keep everything grouped and reversible.
• 	Plan directory structure:
• 	 → clean archive
• 	 → flagged docs
• 	 → soft deletes for undo
• 	 → transparent recordkeeping
• 	Future-proof UI:
• 	Desktop app stays as a power-user interface.
• 	Web portal uses the same backend but with drag-and-drop ingestion.
• 	Both share the same rules hub for consistency.

🚀 Suggested Milestones
1. 	Finalize renamer core (stability, batch cancel, overwrite hybrid).
2. 	Add audit log destination options (console/file/both).
3. 	Implement detection toggle (receipts/documents → separate folder).
4. 	Abstract backend into a callable service (CLI/API).
5. 	Integrate with ingestion portal (drag-and-drop → backend renamer).
6. 	Polish UI for transparency (preview grid, friendly logs).

This way, the renamer becomes the engine room of your family site and future projects. Every new feature we add now is an investment in that bigger vision.
