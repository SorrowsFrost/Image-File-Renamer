# \##### This project and future projects on my little part of Git have 2 purposes. One, make little utilities that I want to use personally and maybe share with friends and family. Nothing super fancy but hopefully not super bland. I have 15 years + experience in Fin Tech, but mainly in support type roles, internally and externally. I never programmed, but was required to debug/diagnose data import issues into our application via interfaces that were written in C. So I had to be able to read and understand whats going on. I mention all of this as it ties into the second part of these projects. I have no formal programming training/schooling. Self taught dabbling and OTJT. I plan to use copilot... yes..yes.. EVIL AI!!! The ones that are gonna steal our jobs and humans will become "useless".

# \##### So far while working with Copilot that hasn't been the feeling I am getting from it. I think people are getting all crazy and don't really understand or grasp the true purpose of all these AI systems. They are super useful and amazing to work it, I will not say anything against that. But the idea that they are going to replace developers is a bit crazy. For example I made a shortcut bar program with copilot as my first application and it basically let you drag and drop folders, images, shortcuts, exe's, had system stats, time, date (which you could click on and it launched outlook, and local weather via API key from Openweather. Works really well and was fun to build with copilot, but we hit an issue that copilot was unable to resolve on its own. We were coming across a problem where the bar would not resize in width automatically. So we decided to just do a set width and it still wouldn't work it was "locked" at a specified width. No matter how much code we threw at it nothing could fix the issue. So I stepped back and started to look over everything in pieces.. using the visual studio visualizer and looking over some variables and taking screen shots, I was able to gather enough information to provide to copilot and it was able to immediately recognize the issue. It was a DPI scaling problem. We slapped in some new code for the DPI issue and boom it was working perfectly.

# 

# \##### That right there is an example of how these AI systems are truly meant to work along side people and not replace. Obviously with the added assistance of AI some jobs will be impacted because the overall quality and speed that things can be accomplished when two "brains" are working together and the ability of Copilot to scaffold out the start of a project so quickly. Less people would be necessary to work on a project. I think companies and solo devs and people in other fields should embrace AI, but not replace people. To make them better.

# 

# \##### So from here on forward all projects that I decide to make public on here are going to be me working alongside copilot, designing, building, and deploying "useful" tools, at least for me. If you do come across these apps and find improvements to them or anything, Fork it.. improve on it and have at it. I honestly do not want to change the applications that I build with outside human assistance, because I want to see if things improve over time as I build new things with Copilot. Obviously the applications need to meet the minimum requirements in these readme's, not look like absolute trash, and finally they shouldn't crash.
